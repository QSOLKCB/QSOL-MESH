# QSOL-MESH

**Heterogeneous compute and memory runtime that calibrates real CPU/GPU silicon, plans workload placement across system RAM and VRAM, and executes deterministic workloads across both.**

MESH separates workload meaning from execution placement. A workload defines what must be computed and how correctness is verified. MESH may decide where, when, and how work executes, but may not redefine the workload.

Initial CLI: `mesh inspect`, `mesh calibrate`, `mesh plan`, `mesh run`, `mesh verify`, `mesh receipt`.

Human-readable explanations live at the repository root. Normative automated-agent authority lives under `machine/`.

## Phase 1 CPU bring-up

The first executable workload is deliberately tiny and dependency-free:

```sh
mesh inspect --json
mesh run smoke --items 100000 --workers 8 --json
mesh verify smoke --items 100000 --workers 8 --json
```

`mesh-smoke-v1` procedurally maps logical IDs to integer values, partitions only contiguous ranges, reduces worker partials in worker-index order, and verifies every run against the scalar reference. It is correctness scaffolding, not a performance benchmark.
